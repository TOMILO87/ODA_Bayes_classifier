# ODA_Bayes_classifier
We use artificial intelligence, in the form of a Bayes classifier, to guess the policy objectives of ODA contributions based on their project descriptions. In total we analyze 396 000 different contributions by 29 countries from 2015-2017. Motivation for doing so is to explore the possibility of mechanically filling in (preliminary) the statistical parameters and also to facilitate quality assurance by flagging contributions which seem miss-classified based on their descriptions.

A description of the project can be found in this blog post:
